# whole_history_rating
a python implementation of RÃ©mi Coulom's Whole-History Rating (WHR) algorithm, adapted to college football advanced analytics.

the original code can be found [here](https://github.com/goshrine/whole_history_rating)


Usage
-----

    from whr import whole_history_rating
    
    whr = whole_history_rating.Base()
    
    # Base.create_game() arguments: home team name, away team name, winner, week, handicap
    # Handicap should generally be less than 500 elo
    whr.create_game("ohio state", "michigan", "H", 1, 0)
    
    # Iterate the WHR algorithm towards convergence with more teams/games, more iterations are needed.
    whr.iterate(50)
    
    # Or let the module iterate until the elo is stable (precision by default 10E-3) with a time limit of 10 seconds by default
    whr.auto_iterate(time_limit = 10, precision = 10E-3)

    # Results are stored in one triplet for each day: [day_number, elo_rating, uncertainty]
    whr.ratings_for_player("ohio state") => 
      [[1, -43, 84], 
       [2, -45, 84], 
       [3, -45, 84]]
    whr.ratings_for_player("ohio state") => 
      [[1, 43, 84], 
       [2, 45, 84], 
       [3, 45, 84]]

    # You can print or get all ratings ordered
    whr.print_ordered_ratings()
    whr.get_ordered_ratings()

    # You can get a prediction for a future game between two teams (even non-existing players)
    # Base.probability_future_match() arguments: home team name, away team name, handicap
    whr.probability_future_match("ohio state", "michigan",0) =>
      win probability: ohio state:37.24%; michigan:62.76%
      
    # You can load several games all together using a file or a list of string representing the game
    # all elements in list must be like: "home_name,away_name,winner,time_step,handicap,extras" 
    # you can exclude handicap (default=0) and extras (default={})
    whr.load_games(["michigan,ohio state,A,1,0", "ohio state,michigan,H,2"])
    whr.load_games(["firstname1 name1, firstname2 name2, A, 1"], separator=",")

    # You can save and load a base (you don't have to redo all iterations)
    whr.save_base(path)
    whr2 = whole_history_rating.Base.load_base(path)
